# C-Codescape

**C-Codescape** is a well-organized repository of C programming practice questions, structured according to a university-level syllabus. It’s designed as a personal journey through the fundamentals of the C language — focusing on logic-building, clean code, and consistency.

Whether you're a beginner looking to strengthen your foundation or someone revising core concepts, this repo is built to help you explore, learn, and grow with clarity.

## ✨ Why "Codescape"?

"C-Codescape" combines two ideas:
- **C** – The foundation of all major programming languages
- **Codescape** – A landscape of code, or a space to escape into focused learning

This repo is my way of escaping into code every day — solving real problems, writing structured programs, and improving both my logic and discipline.

## 📚 What's Inside

This repo is categorized into folders based on topic/logic type, covering:

- ✅ Basic I/O & arithmetic operations  
- ✅ Control structures: if-else, loops, switch-case  
- ✅ Functions & recursion  
- ✅ Arrays, matrices & strings  
- ✅ Pointers  
- ✅ File handling  
- ✅ Real-world logic problems: palindrome, prime, Armstrong, etc.  

Each file is clearly named and easy to compile individually.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Code

If you're new to C, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArpitBreathes/C-Codescape.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a folder:**

    ```bash
    cd C-Codescape/03_Number_Checks
    ```

3. **Compile and run the C file using GCC:**

    ```bash
    gcc strong_number.c -o strong
    ./strong
    ```

You can also use any IDE like **Code::Blocks**, **VS Code**, or **Turbo C++** to compile and run the programs.
